# Word Guess Game

## Introduction
"Mystery Letter Quest" is a simple text-based game where the objective is to guess letters of a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The game is interactive, played entirely through the console, and provides immediate feedback on the player's guesses.

## How to Play

### Starting the Game
- Upon starting the game, players are greeted with the message "Mystery Letter Quest" and prompted to enter their name.

### Word Selection
- The game has a predefined list of words, consisting of various fruits like "apple", "orange", "mango", "banana", and "lemons".
- One word is randomly selected from this list as the target word for the player to guess.

### Gameplay Instructions
- Players are informed that they have only two attempts to guess each letter of the word correctly.

### The Guessing Process
- A placeholder representation of the word is shown, with underscores `_` indicating letters that need to be guessed.
- Players guess one letter at a time. If the guessed letter has already been guessed, the game prompts for a different letter.
- Correct guesses reveal the letter in the placeholder.
- Incorrect guesses prompt a try again message, and the number of attempts increments.
- The game continues until either all letters are guessed correctly or the player uses up their attempts.

### Winning and Losing
- **Win**: If all letters are guessed correctly before running out of attempts, the game congratulates the player, revealing the full word.
- **Lose**: If the player fails to guess the word within the allowed attempts, the game ends, and the correct word is revealed.

### Replay Option
- After a game round concludes, players are asked if they want to play again.
  - **Yes (`Y`)**: The game restarts.
  - **No (`N`)**: The game ends with a thank you message.
  - Any other input prompts a request for a clear "Y" or "N" answer.

## Game End
- Choosing not to play again concludes the session with a "Thanks for playing" message, marking the end of the game.

## Objective
The primary focus of "Mystery Letter Quest" is to provide a fun and engaging way to practice letter guessing and word recognition skills through a simple and interactive game played in the console.
